-------------------

This is a postgres client that does auto-completion and syntax highlighting.

Quick Start
-----------

If you already know how to install python pacakges, then you can simply do:

::

    $ pip install pgcli

If you don't know how to install python pacakges, please check the 
`detailed instructions`__.

__ https://github.com/amjith/pgcli#detailed-installation-instructions 

Usage
-----

:: 

    $ pgcli [database_name]

    or

    $ pgcli postgresql://[user[:password]@][netloc][:port][/dbname] 

Examples: 

:: 

    $ pgcli local_database

    $ pgcli postgres://amjith:pa$$w0rd@example.com:5432/app_db

Features
--------

The `pgcli` is written using prompt_toolkit_.

* Auto-completion as you type for SQL keywords as well as tables and
  columns in the database.
* Syntax highlighting using Pygments.
* Smart-completion (enabled by default) will suggest context-sensitive
  completion.

      - `SELECT * FROM <tab>` will only show table names. 
      - `SELECT * FROM users WHERE <tab>` will only show column names. 

* Config file is automatically created at ~/.pglirc at first launch.
* Primitive support for `psql` back-slash commands.

If you're interested in contributing to this project, first of all I would like
to extend my heartfelt gratitude. I've written a small doc to describe how to
get this running in a development setup.

Detailed Installation Instructions:
-----------------------------------

OS X:
=====

For installing Python pacakges it is recommended to use the package manager
called `pip`. Check if `pip` is installed on the system.

:: 

    $ which pip

If it is installed then you can do:

:: 

    $ pip install pgcli

If that fails due to permission issues, you might need to run the command with
sudo permissions. 

::

    $ sudo pip install pgcli

If pip is not installed check if easy_install is available on the system.

:: 

    $ which easy_install

    $ sudo easy_install install pgcli

Linux:
======

Check if pip is already available in your system.

:: 

    $ which pip

If it does then install pgcli using the pip command as follows:

:: 

    $ sudo pip install pgcli

If it doesn't exist, use your linux package manager to install `pip`. This
might look something like: 

::

    $ sudo apt-get install python-pip

    or

    $ sudo yum install python-pip

Then you can install pgcli: 

:: 

    $ sudo pip install pgcli


Thanks:
-------

A special thanks to `Jonathan Slenders <https://twitter.com/jonathan_s>`_ for
creating `Python Prompt Toolkit <http://github.com/jonathanslenders/python-prompt-toolkit>`_, 
which is quite literally the backbone library, that made this app possible.
Jonathan has also provided valuable feedback and support during the development
of this app.

This app includes the awesome `tabulate <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tabulate>`_ 
library for printing the output of tables. The reason for vendoring this
library rather than listing it as a dependency in setup.py, is because I had to
make a change to the table format which is merged back into the original repo,
but not yet released inPyPI.

`Click <http://click.pocoo.org/3/>`_ is used for command line option parsing
and printing error messages.

Thanks to `psycopg <http://initd.org/psycopg/>`_ for providing a rock solid
interface to Postgres dataabase.

Thanks to all the beta testers and contributors for your time and patience. :)
